    The flare was visible at a distance of more than 1,000 km (620 mi).[49] It was observed in Norway, Greenland and Alaska.[16]
    The explosion's nuclear mushroom rose to a height of 67 km (42 mi).[14] The shape of the "hat" was two-tiered; the diameter of the upper tier was estimated at 95 km (59 mi), the lower tier at 70 km (43 mi). The cloud was observed 800 km (500 mi) from the explosion site.[16]
    The blast wave circled the globe three times,[16] with the first one taking 36 hours and 27 minutes.[50]
    A seismic wave in the earth's crust, generated by the shock wave of the explosion, circled the globe three times.[49]
    The atmospheric pressure wave resulting from the explosion was recorded three times in New Zealand: the station in Wellington recorded an increase in pressure at 21:57, on October 30, coming from the north-west, at 07:17 on October 31, from the southeast, and at 09:16, on November 1, from the northwest (all GMT time), with amplitudes of 0.6 mbar (0.60 hPa), 0.4 mbar (0.40 hPa), and 0.2 mbar (0.20 hPa). Respectively, the average wave speed is estimated at 303 m/s (990 ft/s), or 9.9 degrees of the great circle per hour.[51]
    Glass shattered in windows 780 km (480 mi) from the explosion in a village on Dikson Island.[16]
    The sound wave generated by the explosion reached Dikson Island, but there are no reports of destruction or damage to structures even in the urban-type settlement of Amderma, which is much closer (280 km (170 mi)) to the landfall.[52]
    Ionization of the atmosphere caused interference to radio communications even hundreds of kilometers from the test site for about 40 minutes.[53]
    Radioactive contamination of the experimental field with a radius of 2–3 km (1.2–1.9 mi) in the epicenter area was no more than 1 milliroentgen / hour. The testers appeared at the explosion site 2 hours later; radioactive contamination posed practically no danger to the test participants.[16]
